# Modul-8-Asocial-Media

A parody of a social media website, built with the purpose of anooying users. Features basic authentication, user profiles, user roles(admin, user, muted), ability to post(with images), comment, and like and dislike functionality. Each user is assigned a particular algorithm which obfuscates or changes their posts, although only other users can see this, not the user posting. The change occurs either on the text or the image attached to a post, provided there is one.
